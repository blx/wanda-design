## Introduction

The elevation is the relative distance between two elements along the z-axis. Any object in real-world cast a shadow when elevated, and the shadow has specific properties and appearance based on the elevation degree. At Wonderflow, we want to provide a similar experience by introducing different elevation degrees and systematic shadows based on predefined layers of elevation.
