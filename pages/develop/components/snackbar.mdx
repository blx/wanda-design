);

```js
import { Snackbar } from "@wonderflow/react-components";
```

A Snackbar is a notification that provides brief information to the user without blocking their workflow.

## Usage

This component is used to show inline or floating alerts, but it never stops the user workflow.

<LiveArea fill>
  <Snackbar>
    The Relevance section uses only Feedback with that can be analysed with NLP
    and have a score. <a href="#">Learn more</a>
  </Snackbar>
</LiveArea>

```jsx
<Snackbar>
  The Relevance section uses only Feedback with that can be analysed with NLP
  and have a score. <a href="#">Learn more</a>
</Snackbar>
```

## Types of message

By default the Snackbar uses neutral colors to provide additional informations without alarming the user. With the `kind` property you can change the severity of the message and convey a meaning with the messagge.

<LiveArea fill>
  <Snackbar title="Attention" kind="warning">
    The Relevance section uses only Feedback with that can be analysed with NLP
    and have a score. <a href="#">Learn more</a>
  </Snackbar>
  <Snackbar title="Did you know?" kind="info">
    The Relevance section uses only Feedback with that can be analysed with NLP
    and have a score. <a href="#">Learn more</a>
  </Snackbar>
  <Snackbar title="Good!" kind="positive">
    The Relevance section uses only Feedback with that can be analysed with NLP
    and have a score. <a href="#">Learn more</a>
  </Snackbar>
  <Snackbar title="Ooops!" kind="danger">
    The Relevance section uses only Feedback with that can be analysed with NLP
    and have a score. <a href="#">Learn more</a>
  </Snackbar>
</LiveArea>

```jsx
<Snackbar title="Attention" kind="warning">
  The Relevance section uses only Feedback with that can be analysed with NLP
  and have a score. <a href="#">Learn more</a>
</Snackbar>
```
