import { MdxLayout } from "@/components/layouts/mdx";
import tkns from "@wonderflow/tokens/platforms/web/tokens.json";
import { Snackbar } from "@wonderflow/react-components";

export default ({ children }) => (
  <MdxLayout
    title="Id provider"
    description="Wraps your app to provide stable ids internally."
    showMeta
    features={["Enables stable ids in server rendered environments."]}
  >
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

Wanda's components use auto-generated IDs to handle accessibility-related attributes. While this works well for static websites (SSG), if you are doing server-side rendering you need to wrap your application with this provider in order to keep consistency between IDs generated on the server and the client.

## Anatomy

```jsx
import { IdProvider } from "@wonderflow/react-components";

export default () => (
  <IdProvider>
    <App />
  </IdProvider>
);
```
