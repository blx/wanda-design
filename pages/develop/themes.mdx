Themes are a set of predefined colors paired with common usage and situations. At the moment Wanda provides only the `light` theme but more may be added in the future.

## Usage

A themes is activated by importing the relative `css` or `json` file inside your project (within js or css) or by embedding a `style` tag with its content into your page. Once you include the file all the theme keys will be available as custom properties, eg. `var(--global-foreground)`.

```js
import '@wonderflow/react-components/themes/light.css'
/* or */
import '@wonderflow/react-components/themes/light.json'
```

```html
<style>
  /* Content of light.css */
</style>
```


## Light theme

<ThemeList theme={light} />
