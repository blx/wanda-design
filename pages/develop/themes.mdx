Themes are a set of predefined keys which should be used whenever the color should be dynamic based on the current active theme and they are used to customize component styles to fit the specific aesthetic of a brand or product.
At the moment Wanda provides only the `light` theme but more may come in the future.

## Usage

A themes is activated by importing the relative `css` file inside your project (within js or css) or by embedding a `style` tag with the theme content into your page. Once you include the file all the theme keys will be available as custom properties, eg. `var(--global-foreground)`.

```js
import "@wonderflow/react-components/themes/light.css";
```

```html
<style>
  /* Content of light.css */
</style>
```

## Light theme

<Snackbar kind="info">
  To use the theme keys inside CSS you have to add the standard <b>"--"</b>{" "}
  prefix used for custom properties, for example <b>var(--global-foreground)</b>
</Snackbar>
<br />
<br />
<ThemeList theme={light} />
